How do you get good ideas for startups? That's probably the number one question people ask me.  I'd like to reply with another question: why do people think it's hard to come up with ideas for startups?  That might seem a stupid thing to ask. Why do they think it's hard? If people can't do it, then it is \\nhard, at least for them. Right? \\n Well, maybe not. What people usually say is not that they can't think of ideas, but that they don't have any. That's not quite the same thing. It could be the reason they don't have any is that they haven't tried to generate them.  I think this is often the case.

This can lead to issues within the organization as the weak executive may not have the necessary skills or experience to effectively lead the function. The term is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who faced a similar situation when he bought ABC, and it fell to fourth place in ratings.',\n",
